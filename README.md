### Hi there 👋

I’m a product-focused software engineer building modern web apps with a strong emphasis on UX, performance, and clean architecture.

I enjoy turning vague ideas into working systems, iterating fast, and designing things that feel intentional, not accidental.

- Building with TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js
- Interested in design systems, DX, and AI-assisted workflows
